## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP? Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and it's how browers and servers communicate
- What is a URL? A link to a website comprised of the protocol, hostname, port, resource, and query string
- What is DNS? Stands for domain name service/system. It changes the hostname into an IP Address
- What is a query string? a query string is a set of key, value pairs that provide more information on what you are looking for 
- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? GET: get data from the server POST: send data to the server
- What is an HTTP request? An HTTP request is what gets sent from the browser to the server
- What is an HTTP response? An HTTP respose is what the server sends back to the browser which is then rendered on the browser.
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. An HTTP header gives more information about the request/response. Examples: host, cookies, last-modified
- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? The browser resolves the url into an IP address using DNS. The browser then makes a request to the IP address using HTTP headers. The server then responds (usually with a 200 code). The browser then makes a DOM from the files (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.). Any further requests are handled through separate HTTP requestions and responses are sent from the server.
